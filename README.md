- **[Course 3: Data Science Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology/home/info)**
  - About this Course. Begin by learning about forming the business/research problem Learn how data scientists obtain, prepare, and analyze data. Discover how applying data science methodology practices helps ensure that the data used for problem-solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question. Next, learn about building the data model, deploying that model, data storytelling, and obtaining feedback You’ll think like a data scientist and develop your data science methodology skills using a real-world inspired scenario through progressive labs hosted within Jupyter Notebooks and using Python.

- **[Course 4: Python for Data Science, AI & Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/home/info)**
  - About this course. This introduction to Python course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours—no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn about Python basics and the different data types. You will familiarize yourself with Python Data structures like List and Tuples, as well as logic concepts like conditions and branching. You will use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy & Beautiful Soup. You’ll also use Python to perform tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs.  

- **[Course 5: Python Project for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science/home/info)**
  - About this Course. This mini-course is intended to for you to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. This course primarily involves completing a project in which you will assume the role of a Data Scientist or a Data Analyst and be provided with a real-world data set and a real-world inspired scenario to identify patterns and trends. 
  - [Final Project: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard Assignment](https://github.com/viorbe20/data-science-ibm-course/blob/main/python-project-for-data-science/Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-Final-Assignment.ipynb) 

- **[Course 6: Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/home/info)**
  - About this Course. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. In this course you will learn SQL inside out- from the very basics of Select statements to
advanced concepts like JOINs. You will  practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the Cloud, and use real data science tools. 
  - Overview of projects and methods for databases and SQL for with Python. 

- **[Course 7: Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/home/info)**
  - About this Course. You will learn how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. You will then predict future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and learn how to evaluate them.
